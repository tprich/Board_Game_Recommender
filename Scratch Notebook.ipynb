       "<description>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",

Not a \"ten\" only because the initial card draw can play too large a role, especially if someone has two or three tickets with cities that interrelate, i.e. you complete Seattle to New York and you also have a second card with Seattle that is completed along the way.

It is a great gateway because it's simple, beautiful, and has a very positive first play experience. But please stop saying this is &quot;just&quot; a gateway game. Yes, it is an amazing game to introduce people to the hobby, but it is more than a simple game when experienced players sit down to play. Deep? Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.    I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy.   The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can't pull a game out. The group I play this with make me proud to play games because anyone can win and people can still play with a personal style. That's a very high compliment in my book!  \"/>\n",

       "  'game_des': <description>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets &amp;ndash; goal cards that connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;&amp;quot;The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket &amp;ndash; each turn you either draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets,&amp;quot; says Ticket to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. &amp;quot;The tension comes from being forced to balance greed &amp;ndash; adding more cards to your hand, and fear &amp;ndash; losing a critical route to a competitor.&amp;quot;&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, and wooden scoring markers.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a &amp;quot;gateway game&amp;quot; -- simple enough to be taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players involved and in the game for the duration.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>,\n",

It is a great gateway because it's simple, beautiful, and has a very positive first play experience. But please stop saying this is &quot;just&quot; a gateway game. Yes, it is an amazing game to introduce people to the hobby, but it is more than a simple game when experienced players sit down to play. Deep? Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.    I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy.   The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can't pull a game out. The group I play this with make me proud to play games because anyone can win and people can still play with a personal style. That's a very high compliment in my book!  \"/>\n",

It is a great gateway because it's simple, beautiful, and has a very positive first play experience. But please stop saying this is &quot;just&quot; a gateway game. Yes, it is an amazing game to introduce people to the hobby, but it is more than a simple game when experienced players sit down to play. Deep? Maybe not, but fully engaging to a player choosing to track every detail.    I do think in every way that it is a landmark for the hobby and that was clear from the very beginning. My first set of cards are nearly ragged. And sharing it with my students was a great joy.   The tension can be palpable with some groups, and yet I can play loose with others. I love that range of experience based on my fellow players. Those who say it is all luck fail to regard how you can play your way out of any hand by knowing the game and watching the other players. The best players win much, much more often---but not so much that a new player can't pull a game out. The group I play this with make me proud to play games because anyone can win and people can still play with a personal style. That's a very high compliment in my book!  \"/>\n",

       "<description>Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Part of the Pandemic series&amp;#10;&amp;#10;</description>\n",
